<b>Find the presence of vowels in all possible substrings of the given string</b>

<b>Input</b>

First line contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases.

Each of the next lines contains a string, string contains both lower case and upper case .

<b>Output</b>

Print the vowel sum
Answer for each test case should be printed in a new line.

<b>Input Constraints</b>

1<=T<=10

1<=|S|<=100000


<b>SAMPLE INPUT</b>

1
baceb

<b>SAMPLE OUTPUT</b>

16

<b>Explanation</b>

First line is number of input string, In given example, string is "baceb" so the substrings will be 
like -"b, ba, bac, bace, a, ac, ace, aceb, c, ce, ceb, e, eb, baceb" now the number of vowels in each 
substring will be 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2  and the total number will be sum of all 
presence which is 16.
